## Old Course Notes:

A previous version of the course (with related but **different** content) was taught with a virtual whiteboard (using a Tablet PC).
The whiteboards for [Fundamental groups](../IntroAlgTop.pdf) and [Homology](../homology.pdf) are posted here in PDF format.

Note:  The whiteboard files are in Landscape mode.  Please ensure that the setting is in this mode when printing and rotate while viewing.

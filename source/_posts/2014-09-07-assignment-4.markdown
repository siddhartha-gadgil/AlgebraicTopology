The Mobius band $X$ is the quotient of $[0,1] \times [0,1]$ by the equivalence relation $\sim$ generated by $(0, y) \sim (1, 1 - y)$ for $y\in [0, 1]$.

1. Show that the image $Y$ of the set $\\{(x, 1/2) : x \in [0,1]\\}$ is homeomorphic to a circle.
2. Show that $X$ deformation retracts onto $Y$. Deduce $\pi\_1(X, x\_0)= \mathbb{Z}$ for $x\_0 \in X$.
3. Let $Z$ be the boundary of $X$, namely, the image of the set $\\{(x, y) : y(1 -y) = 0\\}$. Show that $Z$ is homeomorphic to the circle.
4. Let $i: Z \to X$ be the inclusion map and $z\in Z$. Show that the induced homomorphism $i\_*: \pi\_1(Z, z)\to \pi\_1(X, z)$ is an injection but not a surjection.
5. Show that there is no retraction $r :X \to Z$.

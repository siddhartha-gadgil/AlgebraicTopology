    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For sets $X$ and $Y$, let $X\to Y$ denote the set of functions from $X$ to $Y$. It is clear that, for a topological space $X$ there is a bijection between $([0,1]\times [0,1] \to X$ and $[0,1] \to ([0,1] \to X)$ given by associating to $H: [0,1]\times [0,1] \to X$ the function $s\mapsto (t\mapsto H(s,t))$. In this assignment, we shall see that, if we use the appropriate topology on paths in a space $X$, i.e., maps from $[0,1]$ to $X$, this is in fact a bijection between homotopies and paths of paths. </p>

<p>Given topological spaces $X$ and $Y$, the <em>compact open</em> topology on the set $C(C, Y)$ of continuous functions from $X$ to $Y$ is the topology with sub-base constructed as follows. For $K\subset X$ compact and $U\subset Y$ open, we define $V(K, U)$ to be the set of continuous functions $f: X\to Y$ with $f(K)\subset Y$. The sets $V(K, U)$ form a sub-base for the compact-open topology.</p>

<p>Assume henceforth that, for spaces $X$ and $Y$, $C(X, y)$ has the compact-open topology.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Assume that $X$ is a compact topological space and $Y$ is a metric space. Let $f_n: X\to Y$ be a sequence of maps and $f: X\to Y$ be a map. Show that the sequence $f_n$ converges to $f$ in the compact open topology if and only if it converges uniformly to $f$.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let $X$ be a topological space. Show that a function $H: [0,1]\times [0,1] \to X$ is continuous if and only if</p>
    <ul>
      <li>for each $s\in [0,1]$, $f_s: t\mapsto H(s, t)$ is continuous.</li>
      <li>the function $s\maps to f_s$ is a continuous function from $[0,1]$ to $C([0,1], X)$ with the compact open topology.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We begin with a typical topology problem (or rather, collection of problems).</p>

<h3 id="extension-problems">Extension problems:</h3>
<p>Assume we are given topological spaces $X$ and $Y$, a subspace $A\subset X$ and a continuous function $f: A\to Y$. Is there an extension of $f$ to $F: X\to Y$, i.e.,  if $i:A\to X$ is the inclusion function, is there a function $F: X\to Y$ so that $f = F\circ i$?</p>

<p>Two specific instances of this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>$X = [-1,1]$, $A = \{-1,1\}$, $Y =\mathbb{R}$, $f: A\to Y$ is given by $f(x)= x$, for $x=-1,1$.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>$X = [-1,1]$, $A = \{-1,1\}$, $Y =\mathbb{R} \setminus {0}$, $f: A\to Y$ is given by $f(x)= x$, for $x=-1,1$.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>It is not hard to see that the first problem has a positive solution and the second a negative one - in the first case we use a convex function, while the second follows using the fact that the image of a connected set is connected. We shall return to general methods after considering some more problems.</p>

<p>We next describe some features of the extension problem that holds for many topological problems (we use a term from logic for this that can be safely ignored).</p>

<h3 id="first-order-topological-problems">First order topological problems:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>These are formulated in terms of <em>topological spaces</em> and <em>continuous functions</em> (which we call <em>maps</em>) : both the data and unknowns are in terms of these. </li>
  <li>The typical conditions are equalities between various compositions of functions.</li>
  <li>Conditions may also be in terms of topological properties of the spaces.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="more-topological-problems">More topological problems</h2>

<h3 id="homeomorphisms-problem">Homeomorphisms problem:</h3>
<p>Given spaces $X$ and $Y$, are there continuous functions $f: X\to Y$ and $g: Y \to X$ with compositions the identities on $X$ and $Y$?</p>

<h3 id="lifting-problem">Lifting problem</h3>
<p>Given spaces $D$, $X$ and $Y$ and maps $p: Y\to X$ and $f: D\to X$, is there a function $F: D \to Y$ with $f = p\circ F$?</p>

<h2 id="solving-topological-problems">Solving topological problems</h2>

<p>As we can already see in the above examples of extension problems,  showing existence and non-existence involve very different methods. Existence is typical based on constructions, generally using geometry and point-set topology. </p>

<p>On the other hand, the above non-existence result could be done using point-set topology because of the special nature of the spaces - with one of them disconnected. To generalize this, we view connectivity as the $0$-dimensional case of <em>algebraic topology</em>.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-algebraic-topology">What is algebraic topology?</h3>

<p>The idea of algebraic topology is to map a (first order) topological problem to an algebraic one, with spaces mapped to groups (or other algebraic objects) and continuous functions mapped to homomorphisms. We can generally conclude that if a topological existence problem has a solution, then so does the corresponding algebraic problem. </p>

<p>Often simple algebraic arguments show that there is no solution to the algebraic, hence the topological, problem. For instance, if two spaces are homeomorphic, then their associated groups are isomorphic - and hence if we obtain different groups we can conclude that the given spaces are not homeomorphic.</p>
